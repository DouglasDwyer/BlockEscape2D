# BlockEscape2D
Block Escape 2D was a mobile game I created in 2018.  Written in C# using Unity3D, the game consisted of guiding a cube through a maze filled with obstacles and lava.

Block Escape 2D is available for download on [the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KinglyStudios.SimpleVectors).
